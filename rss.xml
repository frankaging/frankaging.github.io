      <title>NOSR (2): The stolen monitor</title>
      <link>https://zen-wu.social/nosr/02/index.html</link>
      <description>Two things usually transcend through time for me: rythms and smells. When chords hit or smells tickle, my brain probably stimulates some memories which drag me back to moments that carry weights. Nothing interesting but I've got a stolen monitor and some stories to share.</description>

      <title>NOSR (1): No one should read</title>
      <link>https://zen-wu.social/nosr/01/index.html</link>
      <description>There are things that grow clearer as I age, while others do not scale linearly. This first NOSR post shares a few thoughts—expecting no reader, hence the name.</description>

      <title>Physics and world perception from double-slit experiment</title>
      <link>https://zen-wu.social/physics/index.html</link>
      <description>I try to make sense of the world by reasoning things down to known theorms. Double-slit experiment is clearly one of the outliers of such reasoning. I was bothered by it for a while. With my limited knowledge about quantum physics, I will share some of my thoughts on how I perceive the world through the lens of physics.</description>

      <title>What is representation finetuning?</title>
      <link>https://zen-wu.social/reft/index.html</link>
      <description>Representation finetuning (ReFT) represents a novel approach to parameter-efficient, powerful, and interpretable fine-tuning of language models.</description>

      <title>Scaling interpretability with LLMs</title>
      <link>https://zen-wu.social/boundless_das/index.html</link>
      <description>Building on the theory of causal abstraction, we release Boundless DAS for finding representations that play causal roles in LLMs with billions of parameters.</description>
